### Databases and Datamining <br />

##The objective of the task : <br />
In the context of this assignment, you will be asked to apply a range of classification techniques, compare models to each other and decide the best.
#Problem:<br />
Anticipating bugs in software projects is a very interesting and difficult issue. One way to approach the problem is to sort the various components of the system by using metrics on the ones they have and those that are not error-prone. The problem you will encounter is a set of Eclipse classes, as well as calculated metrics for these classes. You are asked to successfully classify these classes in incorrect (with bugs) and “clean” (no bugs)
