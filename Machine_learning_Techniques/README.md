classification / regression using the Support / Restructuring Support Machines you have
learn. You have to create the corresponding models, evaluate them, make them
Compare and choose the best for the set of data you choose.
The dataset was collected at 'Hospital Universitario de Caracas' in Caracas, Venezuela. The dataset comprises demographic information, habits, and historic medical records of 858 patients. Several patients decided not to answer some of the questions because of privacy concerns (missing values).
